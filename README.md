<h1>Encouragement CLI</h1>
---

Make the command line interface say something uplifting or encouraging when opened. Everyone has bad days, sometimes all you need in a kind word. The Encouragement CLI will do that for you.

Currently this only works on Mac OSX because that's what I am using right now.
